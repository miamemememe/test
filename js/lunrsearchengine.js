    "body": "AboutIntroduction: Opened on March 15, 2004, Jockey Club Academy Hall (JCAC) has quickly ascended to be one of the most dynamic halls in City University of Hong Kong. It embraces the whole-person education ideal of the University, offering students a balanced life and an extension of learning beyond the classroom. Students’ intellectual development and self-governance are encouraged by the free and energetic ambience of the Hall, as exemplified by the quick formation of the Provisional Residents’ Association (PRA) in November 2004 and the inauguration of the First Residents’ Association (RA) in November 2005. The RA manages the Hall facilities and organizes activities for the Academians including high table dinners, arts and cultural programmes, community services, sports events and various interest groups. There are also 11 Floor Committees that help to promote the active participation of residents in hall life. The beauty of JCAC not only resides in its panoramic view overlooking the Kowloon Peninsula, but above all in the people who live and learn together as an integral part of a cheerful, energetic and caring community. Location and Facilities: JCAC enjoys the geographical advantage of being the hall that lies closest to the campus. With Beacon Hill behind, the hall has a panoramic vista of Kowloon Peninsula and Hong Kong Island. It is equipped with a Gym Room, Pool Table, video game set, and other hall facilities. The RTs manage the facilities and maintain them to best suit residents’ needs. Activities and Residents’ Involvement: To enrich residents’ learning experiences outside the classroom, the Residence Tutors (RTs) and the Residents’ Association (RA) organize about over 20 hall activities every year, on top of activities organized within each floor. These activities widely cover cultural exchanges, community services, inter-hall competitions, career, and academic development. Unity and Sense of Belonging: What’s more, JCAC RA has the longest history amongst those of all CityU halls, and it is an autonomous association run by the residents. “Academian” is an identity to be proud of. Submerged in its caring and family-like environment at JCAC, Academians are united and have a strong sense of belonging to the hall. The strong spirit has led us into winning the Best Cheering Hall prizes in almost every inter-hall cheering competitions over the past few years. ABC CULTURE: “A” stands for Academic Excellence. To live up to the name of our hall, Academians are encouraged to be serious about their studies and strive for academic excellence. Our Residence Tutors (RTs), who have all been successful in their undergraduate studies, stand ready to give you advice and guidance in this aspect apart from taking care of you. You are welcome to talk to them, e-mail them or make appointments with them for personal consultation. They all have a name poster on their room doors for your easy identification. “B” is the acronym for Balanced Development. JC Academy Hall embraces the whole-person education ideal of the Univeristy through offering you a wealth of opportunites for learning outside the classroom. The Residents’ Association is committed, and has been doing a great job, in organizing a broad range of programmes to cultivate Academians’ interests and developments in arts and culture, sports and social concern. So, apart from studying, do watch out for and take advantage of the various activities brought to you by the hall for a balanced life and self-enhancement. “C” is for Community Citizenship. Academians are living in a community characterised by a diversity of people, ideas and lifestyles. Furthermore, over 90% of you are staying in shared rooms where your living habits may be quite different from those of your roommates. To ensure the enjoyment of a safe, healthy, secure and harmonious living environment for all Academians, it is important that every one of us act as a good, responsible and mature citizen of the Academian living community, with a strong sense of respect and consideration for others. Scholarship: Jockey Club Academy Hall (A) Academian Scholarships Jockey Club Academy Hall is committed to whole-person education. To recognize residents’ outstanding pursuit of the Academian culture, i. e. Academic Excellence, Balanced Development and Community Citizenship, a scholarship scheme has been established.

    "body": "2025/03/08 - The basketball team’s preparation for the Interhall Competition reflected teamwork and dedication. Players trained 2-4 times a week in the weeks leading up to the games, transforming from individual players to a team. Each training session was tailored to work not just on physical skills but also to internalize the ins and outs of the game. Practice went far beyond just drills. Hours were spent refining technical skills, practicing dribble moves, mastering shooting techniques, and learning sophisticated defensive strategies. The coaches were interested in more than just athleticism; they built a culture focused on mental resilience, tactical intelligence, and team communication. As the tournament drew near, the chemistry of the team became more evident. Players could foresee each other’s actions, talk seamlessly on the court, and complement one another in difficult situations. Their exhaustive training included a thorough study of game rules, strategic meetings, and rigorous physical training.  The tournament itself was a true testament to their hard work. The women’s team demonstrated remarkable talent, fighting through to the semi-finals of a series of challenging games. Their third-place game against Hall 6 was particularly one to remember, ending in a heart-stopping 6:5 score that demonstrated their sheer determination and skill. The play by the men’s team on March 8th, which resulted in a loss of 46-33 to Halls 12 &amp; 13, was equally astonishing. Their behavior throughout the match demonstrated sportsmanship and strategic insight that ultimately outweighed the bottom line.  It wasn’t just this team’s strength that truly differentiated them; it was also the team spirit of the athletes, the encouragement they gave each other from the support of the cheer team, and the enthusiasm from the community made these games so unique. The Interhall Basketball Competition was something beyond games. It was a personal and team-building experience, an affirmation of the possibilities when extensive training, mutual support, and eager commitment come together to shape a collection of individual players into a truly superior team. No trophies were earned, but the team gained something far more valuable—a deep understanding of teamwork, individual resilience, and what competitive sports are all about.  "

    "body": "2025/02/24 - On the night of the 24th of February 2025, the Indonesian Traditional Game student initiated activity was held at the G/F common room. It provided insight for our curious academians to learn about the traditional games that are often played in Indonesia. Hosted by Calysta and Krista, the Indonesian traditional game introduced 3 interesting games for our academians to play, which consisted of “Congklak”, “Bekel”, and “Stik Es-krim”. It was definite that all the participants had a great time playing all the traditional games that were provided. The first game that was introduced to the academians that joined the Indonesian Traditional Game activity was “Congklak”. Congklak is a traditional Indonesian mancala game played on a wooden board with 14 pits and two larger “home” pits, using small shells, seeds, or stones as counters. The objective is to collect the most counters in your “home” by strategically distributing them across the board in a counterclockwise direction. As it was a paired game, the academians joined in pairs to battle each other out in the ultimate fight of strategy, counting, and patience, to end up having the most beads in their home pit. Overall, this game was extremely engaging and fun for everyone to try, especially how this game had numerous other variation that are also played in other countries.  The second game is also a game that has been seen to have their own style in other countries, which is called “bekel”. Bekel is a traditional Indonesian game played with a rubber ball and small metal objects called bekel pieces. The objective is to bounce the ball while picking up the metals and being able to catch the bouncing ball, requiring both dexterity and coordination. The game will get harder, as the current round number you are playing indicates how much metal pieces you need to pick up whilst the ball bounces. This game can also increase in difficulty if academians choose to use smaller balls which makes them harder to be caught while bouncing. The final game, also did not disappoint as it was the most nerve-wrecking game that the academians played. It was “stik-es krim”, which directly translates to Ice cream stick. The game is a popular children’s game, usually played by primary school students. It is played by having an ice cream stick, hitting the ground using your hand, and creating a force to flip your ice cream stick forward. The game is won when you flip your ice cream stick on top of your opponent’s ice cream stick. Despite the game sounding silly, it is actually a fun game to play, when you are looking to cool off after a long day at university.  The Indonesian Traditional Game student-initiated activity was a delightful evening that brought laughter, excitement, and cultural appreciation to the G/F common room. Through games like Congklak, which tested strategy and patience, Bekel, which challenged dexterity and coordination, and the lighthearted yet thrilling Stik Es-krim, participants not only had the chance to immerse themselves in the charm of Indonesia’s traditional games but also created memorable moments of fun and camaraderie. Hosted brilliantly by Calysta and Krista, the event succeeded in fostering curiosity and joy among all academians, leaving everyone with a deeper appreciation for Indonesia’s rich cultural heritage.
